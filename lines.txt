Hey, want to play? We haven't played together since we where children! And the day is so nice and bright!
Uhhh... I can't! I, um, I need to study for my entrance exams! I do not want to not make it into college!
Maybe next time :).
Ok...

Hey, I have seen you around campus a lot, mainly here at the library though.
Want to hangout sometime?
Sorry, I can't! I need to work on cleaning up my resume.
Yeah, of course. Do what you need to do.

... I've been studying for way too long. Should I give it a rest?...
No, I shouldn't. What would I even do anyways? No one invited me out to do anything regardless.

I should invite... huh.
Oh...
